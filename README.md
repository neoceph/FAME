[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/badge/TestPyPI-0.0.5-blue)](https://test.pypi.org/project/FAME-UD/)

## Development Instructions: [here](docs/developerReadme/development.md) &  Documentation: [here](https://fame-ud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Overview
FAME is a simulation tool designed to model the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN). This tool helps in understanding the thermal and mechanical behavior of materials during the LPBF process.

## Features
- **Thermal Simulation**: Models the heat distribution and cooling rates.
- **Mechanical Simulation**: Analyzes stress and deformation.
- **Material Properties**: Supports various materials with customizable properties.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to set up and run simulations.

## Installation
To install FAME you need to have anaconda installed then clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neoceph/FAME.git
cd FAME
conda env create -f environment_linux.yaml
```

## Usage
To run a simulation, use the following command:
```bash
fame --input your_config_file.yaml
```
Replace `your_config_file.yaml` with your specific configuration file.

## Configuration
The configuration file should include parameters such as:
- Laser power
- Scan speed
- Layer thickness
- Material properties
